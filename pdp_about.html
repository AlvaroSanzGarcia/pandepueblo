              <p>
                  <b>Easier to digest</b><br />
                  The fermentation process breaks down the gluten in wheat flour, making sourdough easier
                  to digest than other breads.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  <b>More nutritious</b><br />
                  Sourdough is rich in nutrients like vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  <b>Heart-healthy</b><br />
                  The fiber, potassium, phosphorus, and sodium in sourdough support a healthy heart. The
                  soluble fiber in sourdough binds to cholesterol in the small intestine, helping to pass
                  it through the body.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  <b>Fewer preservatives</b><br />
                  Sourdough's natural acidity and fermentation process reduce the need for chemical
                  preservatives.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  <b>May prevent disease</b><br />
                  The antioxidants in sourdough can protect cells from damage that can lead to serious
                  diseases like cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  <b>May help manage blood sugar</b><br />
                  The bacteria in sourdough changes the structure of the bread's starch molecules, which
                  helps the body absorb them more slowly. This means that insulin levels won't spike as
                  much after eating sourdough as they would after eating white bread.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  <b>Good for gut health</b><br />
                  The fiber in sourdough feeds the beneficial bacteria in your intestines, which helps 
                  maintain a healthy digestive system.

               <h1>Pan de Pueblo</h1>
               <p>
                   Welcome to Pan de Pueblo, your home for wholesome, delicious sourdough bread made with love
                   and tradition. Our bakery was born out of necessity and creativity during the COVID-19
                   lockdown in 2020. In a time of uncertainty and isolation, the simple act of baking bread
                   became a source of comfort and connection. This humble beginning laid the foundation for what
                   Pan de Pueblo stands for todayâ€”a commitment to quality, simplicity, and the joy of sharing good
                   bread with our community.
               </p>
               <p>
                   At Pan de Pueblo, we believe that great bread starts with great ingredients. Our philosophy is
                   simple: bread should be made with wholesome ingredients, free from artificial additives and
                   unnecessary enhancers. Every loaf is crafted with care using just flour, water, salt, and our
                   naturally cultured sourdough starter. This dedication to purity ensures that our bread is not
                   only delicious but also nourishing, embodying the true essence of artisanal baking.

                   Our journey began in our home kitchen, where we experimented with different techniques and
                   recipes, refining our craft with each bake. The overwhelming support and positive feedback
                   from our friends, family, and neighbors inspired us to share our passion with a wider audience.
                   Today, Pan de Pueblo is more than just a bakery; it is a symbol of resilience and the power of
                   community. We take pride in every loaf we bake, knowing that it represents the heart and soul
                   of our efforts during challenging times.

                   Quality is at the core of everything we do at Pan de Pueblo. From sourcing the finest ingredients
                   to meticulously monitoring every step of the baking process, we are unwavering in our commitment
                   to excellence. Our breads are slow-fermented to develop deep, complex flavors and a perfect crust,
                   offering a taste experience that is both traditional and unique. We believe that this attention to
                   detail is what sets our bread apart and keeps our customers coming back for more.
